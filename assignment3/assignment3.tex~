  \item By using this algorithm we can gaurentee that we avoid the
    worst case for \texttt{QUICKSORT}.  We can add a call to
    \texttt{SELECT} to the pivot corresponding to the \(i^{th}\)
    order statistic (the median for example) for the input array
    \(A\).
    Since \texttt{PARTITION} and \texttt{SELECT} runs in \(\Theta(n)\)
    time this means that we never have to worry about the worst case
    (\(\Theta(n^2)\),
    and we don't increase in the asymptotic running time of
    \texttt{PARTITION}.
  \item This bound is preferred because it is a guarantee not a
    probabilistic expectation.
